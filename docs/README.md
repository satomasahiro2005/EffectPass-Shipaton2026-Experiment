# docs

What each file here is. Design documents describe how something works now; notes are
records of one integration, investigation or test day and are not kept up to date.

Most of these were written for EffectDeck, the free app EffectPass is built from, before
EffectPass was split off. Where they say EffectDeck, the same applies to EffectPass's code,
and issue numbers refer to EffectDeck's tracker.

## Design

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [external-processor.md](external-processor.md) | The `ETExternalProcessor` boundary that AUv3 and JSFX nodes run through, and the EffeTune patches it needs |
| [multichannel-output.md](multichannel-output.md) | Output on 2–16 channel audio interfaces, Routing, Bass Management |
| [jsfx-host-test-design.md](jsfx-host-test-design.md) | Test design for the JSFX host (Japanese). Partly implemented; its status section maps sections to `Tests/Unit/JSFX*Tests.swift` |

The contracts for users and language models are at the top of the repository:
[`JSFX.md`](../JSFX.md) and [`CHAIN.md`](../CHAIN.md).

## Logs

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [battery-log.md](battery-log.md) | Issue #5, battery drain with the screen off (Japanese). A running log: measured and guessed are kept apart, dead ends stay in |

## Notes

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [notes/effetune-2.10.0.md](notes/effetune-2.10.0.md) | What the EffeTune 2.10.0 integration changed |
| [notes/effetune-2.11.0.md](notes/effetune-2.11.0.md) | What the EffeTune 2.11.0 (DSP 0.11.0) integration changed |
| [notes/au-post-insert.md](notes/au-post-insert.md) | The first AUv3 host, a fixed post-insert. Superseded by AU nodes in the chain |
| [notes/mde-routing-question.md](notes/mde-routing-question.md) | The question for issues #3 and #4: when iOS keeps a player on the EffectDeck route |
| [notes/mde-routing-answer.md](notes/mde-routing-answer.md) | The answer, reconstructed from iOS 27's `MediaExperience` (Japanese) |
| [notes/test-2026-09-20.md](notes/test-2026-09-20.md) | The device checklist for build 2026.09.20 (Japanese) |
| [notes/screencapturekit.md](notes/screencapturekit.md) | Why ScreenCaptureKit cannot replace another app's audio, measured on iOS 27.2 beta 2 (Japanese). An EffectDeck note inherited with its code; its conclusions are about EffectDeck |

## Images

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `icon.png`, `icon-dark.png` | The EffectPass app icon (orange), light and dark. The README shows them |
| `shot-*.png` | The README screenshots, taken from EffectPass on the iPad simulator |

## Not in the repository

Some tracked files cite `docs/connect-log.md` (the log of the Unable to Connect
investigation) and `docs/apple/` (copies of Apple documentation). Both are kept only on the
owner's machine and are listed in `.gitignore`, as are the other local notes there. The
citations are kept so the owner can follow them; there is nothing to fetch.
