# What is bundled

**EffectPass is not part of the EffeTune project.** It is a separate app by nemut.ai,
built from the code of EffectDeck (also by nemut.ai, and also not part of EffeTune), that
bundles EffeTune's DSP core under the MIT license. It is not endorsed by or supported by the
author of EffeTune. Send anything about this app to nemut.ai, and do not open issues about
it on the EffeTune repository.

The app shows the license texts in Settings → Licenses. `Tools/gen_licenses.py` reads them
from the files named here.

## EffeTune

The audio processing is EffeTune's DSP core (`dsp/`):
[EffeTune](https://github.com/Frieve-A/effetune), included here as the submodule at
`Vendor/effetune`.

MIT License / Copyright (c) 2025-2026, Yoshiyuki Kobayashi

It is used with small patches that connect it to the app. `Scripts/setup.sh` applies
`Patches/abi-begin-ptr.diff` and `Patches/effetune-external-*.diff` to `dsp/core` before
each build; the patches are the complete list of changes.

EffeTune's `dsp/` is host-neutral C++20 with no browser or WebAudio API in it, so it
builds for iOS arm64 directly, without going through WASM.

## RevenueCat purchases-ios

The subscription gate (EffectPass Pro) uses the RevenueCat SDK:
[RevenueCat/purchases-ios](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios), added as a Swift
package (`RevenueCat` and `RevenueCatUI`, pinned in `project.yml`).

MIT License / Copyright (c) 2024 RevenueCat, Inc.

## PFFFT

Used for the FFT inside EffeTune's DSP core. `Vendor/effetune/dsp/vendor/pffft`.

## ysfx

The JSFX host: [JoepVanlier/ysfx](https://github.com/JoepVanlier/ysfx), included as the
submodule at `Vendor/ysfx`, pinned to `5c3452fe`.

Copyright 2021 Jean Pierre Cimalando; later changes by Joep Vanlier and contributors

Apache License 2.0. Full text in `Vendor/ysfx/LICENSE`.

**Modified.** `Scripts/setup.sh` applies `Patches/ysfx-effectdeck-ios.diff` to ysfx and to
two WDL files under it. The patch is the complete list of changes; its header names the
upstream WDL fixes it carries.

## WDL (EEL2, LICE, FFT)

From Cockos' WDL, as vendored by ysfx at `Vendor/ysfx/thirdparty/WDL`. EffectPass compiles
the EEL2 interpreter (portable, no JIT), LICE (drawing for `@gfx`) and `fft.c`.

Copyright (C) 2005 and later Cockos Incorporated. Portions copyright other contributors,
see each source file. `fft.c` is based on DJBFFT, Copyright 1999 D. J. Bernstein.

zlib license. Full text in `Vendor/ysfx/thirdparty/WDL/LICENSE.txt`. Altered:
`eel2/nseel-compiler.c` and `lice/lice.cpp`, by `Patches/ysfx-effectdeck-ios.diff`.

## DPF Base64

ysfx compiles `Vendor/ysfx/sources/base64/Base64.hpp`, taken from the DISTRHO Plugin
Framework (DPF). The license is in the file's header. `Licenses/dpf-base64.LICENSE` is a
copy of it, which `Tools/gen_licenses.py` reads and checks against the header.
